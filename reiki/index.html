        <h2>Reiki healing</h2>
<p>Reiki is a Japanese word meaning 'Universal Life Energy', an energy which is all around us. It is the name given to a system of natural healing which evolved in Japan from the experience and dedication of Dr Mikao Usui. </p>

<p>It is a system of healing and self-healing that anyone can access. Being focussed on the whole person, and the person's innate ability to heal itself, it will complement any treatment you are having. </p>



<p>Reiki is a safe, gentle and non-intrusive hands-on healing technique which induces relaxation and stress reduction. It also promotes healing. Today, Reiki continues to be taught by Reiki Masters who have trained in the tradition passed down from Master to student. </p>

<p>The method of receiving a Reiki treatment from a practitioner is a very simple process. While remaining fully dressed the person simply lies on a couch and relaxes. The practitioner gently places their hands in a sequence of positions which cover the whole body. An average treatment usually lasts an hour with each position held for several minutes, leaving the person feeling very relaxed and peaceful. </p>

<p>I am a qualified Second Degree Reiki Practitioner.<br>
I offer Reki sessions to my patients and anyone who is interested in experiencing this gentle, healing energy. </p>

	<p><q>&ldquo;I have been fortunate enough to experience Lizzie Austin as a Homeopath, a Reflexologist, and a Reiki practitioner. In all three therapies she has been enormously helpful and effective. She is skilled at getting to the very heart of what a patient needs, and has a calming, loving presence that enhances the chosen mode of therapy. I unreservedly recommend her.&rdquo;</q><br />
