        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>I started my adult life in nursing, then married, and spent a few years living in Europe before taking a years correspondence course in herbal medicine. I was led to study homeopathy through particular health issues of my own, and the homeopathic treatment helped me so much at the time, that I decided to train as a professional homeopath.</p>

    <span class="caption">Apis mellifera (honeybee)</span></div><p>Starting at the College of Homeopathy in London, I finished my training at the School of  Homeopathy in Devon, and then registered with the Society of Homeopaths in  1990. I have since trained in transpersonal  psychology and counselling skills, and this approach has greatly influenced my  work as a professional homeopath, as well as my own personal development.</p>

    <p>I have undertaken many postgraduate courses  and seminars in homeopathy; including Jeremy Sherr's Dynamis course and Rajan  Sankaran's seminars for professional homeopaths in India. I am  particularly interested in the classical approach taught by the homeopaths in  Bombay, and integrate this 'sensation' method into my practice as much as  possible.</p>

    <p>I am also a fully qualified professional Reflexologist, having trained at the London School of Reflexology under the tuition of Louise Keet PGCE, MAR, and I am a member of the Association of Reflexologists. <a href="../reflexology/index.html">Read more about foot reflexology</a>. I also trained with Ziggie Bergman in <a href="../reflexology/facial-reflexology/index.html">facial Reflexology and facelift massage</a>.</p>
    <p>And having trained in Reiki healing with Ama Boisard, a Reiki Master/teacher and member of the UK Reiki Foundation, I qualified as a Reiki Level 2 practitioner in 2011.</p>
