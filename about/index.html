<div class="editable">
<p class="initial">Following on from a correspondence course in herbal medicine, I decided to train as a professional homeopath and joined the Society of Homeopath’s professional register in the 1990’s, and began to practice.</p>
  <p>I also took part in a 2-year course with workshops in transpersonal psychology around the same time, and this training nourished me personally and helped me to understand more about myself and other people.</p>
  <p>Transpersonal psychology, Buddhism and 5 rhythms dance have influenced my work in complementary medicine, and my own personal development.</p>
  <p>From 2011 I trained in Reiki healing, then as a Reflexologist, as I wished to work in a more hands-on way with people.</p>
  <p>More recently I have increased my focus on these therapies and have been amazed at the results.</p>
  <p>I now offer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Foot reflexology;</li>
    <li>Facial reflexology;</li>
    <li>Homeopathy;</li>
    <li>Facial reflexology with Reiki healing;</li>
    <li>Facial reflexology with facelift massage;</li>
    <li> Crystals with reflexology;</li>
    <li>And: a combination of facial and foot reflexology in one session.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Also offering specialised home visits for the elderly and/or disabled</strong><br>
    (available in Headington or in the OX1/OX2 areas of Oxford) </p>

    <p>I highly recommend Lizzie, she built a great
      relationship with my sister.  Lizzie did foot reflexology
      massage and also reading on a weekly basis.  My sister
      really looked forward to the visits from Lizzie, she
      responded well to the reflexology and she enjoyed
      &#39;Where the Crawdads sing&#39;, a lovely story involving a
      court case. Lizzie also visited my sister in hospital and
      went above and beyond for my sister. We really
      appreciated having Lizzie involved</p>
