<h2>About reflexology</h2>
<p class="initial">Reflexology is an ancient therapy based on the principle that different parts of the body are reflected in the feet and/or hands. Reflexology helps to promote wellbeing and health by the application of gentle pressure or massage to different areas on the feet or hands. It is also a deeply relaxing treatment.</p>

<p>By using gentle pressure on specific reflexes on the feet, my aim is to stimulate and so improve circulation; and to restore balance and healthy functioning within the body.</p>

<p>As a holistic practitioner, I am able to offer a deeply relaxing and nurturing treatment that will aim to boost the immune system, relieve stress and tension, and improve general wellbeing.</p>
<p>The benefits of receiving reflexology treatment can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feeling of deep relaxation and a reduction in stress</li>
  <li>Improved energy levels and circulation</li>
  <li>A stronger immune system along with removal of toxins from the body</li>
  <li>A feeling of harmony and a return to a state of natural balance </li>
  <li>Improved sleep</li>
  <li>Hormonal balance in women</li>
</ul>
<p> ..and many other improvements in health.</p>
<p>After a treatment, it is important to drink plenty of water to help flush away toxins and impurities from the body. Resting afterwards will also aid the healing process.</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>Reflexology has been used for many thousands of years in China, and also in Egypt. </p>
<p>The reflexology method we use in the present day were developed in America by a woman called Eunice Ingham. She based her technique on ‘Zone Therapy’ described earlier in the 1920’s by Dr William Fitzgerald. Reflexology was brought to Britain by Doreen Bayly in the early 1960’s, who was determined to stimulate interest and awareness of this most beneficial and relaxing therapy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lizzie is an empathetic and considerate therapist. She took great care of me and was diligent in following up the effects of the previous session. I felt very safe with her and wholeheartedly recommend her as a Reflexologist.</p>
