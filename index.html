<p><span class="initial">Homeopathy</span> is a gentle and holistic system of healing which assists the natural tendency of the body towards self-healing. Homeopaths view the symptoms of disease as expressions of disharmony within the whole person and their remedies stimulate the immune system to heal the body and return it to a greater level of health and wellbeing. <a href="homeopathy/index.html">Read more </a>...<br>

<p><span class="initial">Reflexology</span> is an ancient therapy based on the principle that various parts of the feet, hands or face correspond to different organs or glands within the body. Stimulating these reflexes using gentle pressure will have a corresponding effect throughout the body, and help to gently restore balance and wellbeing.  Although reflexology is an extremely beneficial therapy in its own right, it can also work alongside homeopathy to offer a deeply relaxing treatment to help deal with stress and support the healing process. Read more about <a href="reflexology/index.html">foot reflexology</a> and <a href="reflexology/facial-reflexology/index.html">facial reflexology</a>.</p>
<p><span class="initial">Reiki</span> is a safe, gentle and non-intrusive hands-on healing technique that induces relaxation and reduces stress. As its focus is on the whole person and the person's innate ability to heal itself, it will also complement other treatments such as reflexology or homeopathy. <a href="reiki/index.html">Read more</a> ...</p>
<p>People often seek help from homeopathy, reflexology, reiki or other complementary therapies as a form of prevention, as well as for existing conditions previously diagnosed by their medical practitioner. I will always direct patients to their medical practitioner or GP whenever necessary in order to have tests or discuss options.</p>

<p><q>&ldquo;I have been fortunate enough to experience Lizzie Austin as a Homeopath, a Reflexologist, and a Reiki practitioner. In all three therapies she has been enormously helpful and effective. She is skilled at getting to the very heart of what a patient needs, and has a calming, loving presence that enhances the chosen mode of therapy. I unreservedly recommend her.&rdquo;</q><br />
