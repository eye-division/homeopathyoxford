<p class="initial">Combining the healing energies of crystals with Reflexology enhances the harmonising effect of the treatment, and brings a very different experience to the recipient.<br>
This specialised reflexology session can help anyone who finds it difficult to let go of tension and stress to re-balance and deeply relax. </p>
<p>Crystals are chosen specifically and are used on areas of the feet to balance the chakras; and a crystal wand or mushroom-shaped crystal may be applied gently on tender reflex points to improve balance, circulation and to stimulate inner healing.</p>
<p>Unique crystals may also be carefully chosen and placed on the person or underneath the couch while treatment is taking place.</p>


<blockquote>
  <p>For about four years now, I consider myself very lucky to have experienced the healing power of homeopathy, reflexology and reiki as an alternative to conventional medical treatment.  Lately I have tried crystal reflexology healing as well. I had three sessions and totally enjoyed it!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>After each session my whole body is so relaxed for the rest of the day, and afterwards I feel revived and happy.</p>

   <p>Meeting Lizzie changed my life - she is so calming, considerate and makes me feel very special. Always concerned about any pain or sensitivity I might have felt, gives me feedback every time. And she has such a lovely and warm personality. I can certainly say - She is simply the best!</p>
