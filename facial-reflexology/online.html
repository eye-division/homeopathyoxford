<p class="initial">If you’re looking for a treatment from the comfort of your own home, you can now access my  Facial Reflexology self-care sessions via Zoom. Don’t worry if you have never tried it, I’ll talk you through everything you’ll need to know.</p>
<p>Virtual Treatments have opened up opportunities for people suffering with stress and anxiety, pain and disability to enjoy the benefits of a treatment in their home without the need for face-to-face contact.<br>
Virtual Facial Reflexology is important for clients who are unable to leave the house for various reasons including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Self-Isolation</li>
  <li>Transport difficulties and/or living at a distance from the Clinic</li>
  <li>Patients on immuno-suppressant drugs</li>
  <li>Patients in at-risk groups due to having respiratory, heart conditions or diabetes for example</li>    
</ul>

<h3>What does Virtual Facial Reflexology involve?</h3>

<p>You will be sent a link to join a video call. Before the video call you will be assessed in a short consultation designed to understand any symptoms of physical or emotional discomfort you may have, and what may be done to improve things. Once you are comfortable we will begin the facial reflexology, and you will follow my techniques and mirror these on your own face.  I will be able to see you, and can check your pressure and technique every step of the way as you are guided through a short Facial Reflexology sequence. It will also include relaxing, stretching movements and end with a gentle meditation to help you let go of any stress or worries. From your assessment I can usually get a good idea of what the problem is and formulate a treatment plan to help you.</p>

<h3>What problems can Facial Reflexology help with?</h3>

<p>Virtual Facial Reflexology has been shown to help with a wide range of conditions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stress and anxiety, and can smooth away tension</li>
  <li>It lifts the mood</li>
  <li>And oxygenates facial muscles</li>
  <li>It improves headaches</li>
  <li>And improves effects of bruxism and teeth grinding</li>
  <li>Plus many more...</li>
</ul>

<p>If your problem isn’t listed above, give me a call on 07780542068 to discuss whether you would benefit from a Virtual Facial Reflexology treatment, or an appointment in the clinic.</p>
