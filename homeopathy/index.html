        <h2>About homeopathy</h2>
      <p>Homeopathy has been described as a gentle,  holistic system of healing suitable for everyone; babies and children , men and  women, young and old.</p>
<div class="left"><img src="../images/gold.jpg" width="388" height="257" alt="Photograph of raw gold" /><br />
<span class="caption">Aurum metallicum (raw gold)</span></div><p>People seek homeopathic help for all sorts of  complaints. Many now use it as an alternative to conventional medical  treatment. Others use it to complement their conventional treatment as they  feel sure  that it will not interfere  with the action of the drugs they take.         Homeopathy considers that the symptoms of  disease are expressions of disharmony within the whole person, and  that we cannot treat one part of the body  without affecting the whole. </p>
<p>The remedies work on the principle known as 'the  Law of Similars' or 'like cures like'. This law states that a substance that  can cause symptoms of disease can also cure it.         For example, when we chop onions our eyes begin  to water and our nose runs; by the same token, a potentized preparation of  common onion (Allium cepa) may be given as a homeopathic remedy for some forms of hayfever and rhinitis where the main symptoms include runny eyes and nose. </p>
<p> The Law of Similars  was observed as long ago as 400BC by the Greek physician Hippocrates, but it  was only 220 years ago that the development of this law into a system of  medicine was proposed by a German physician called Samuel Hahnemann.        <br />
