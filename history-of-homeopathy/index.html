        <h2>History of homeopathy</h2>
        <p>Homeopathy is a  system of medicine founded by the celebrated German physician Dr Samuel  Hahnemann (1755-1843). Hahnemann first used the word homeopathy  (homoios in Greek means 'similar', pathos means 'suffering') to refer to the  principle of the law of similars.</p>

<span class="caption">Calendula officinalis with medicine bottles</span></div><p>The law of similars was known in the ancient  world; it was described by Hippocrates and Paralcelcus and has been utilized by  many cultures, but it was Hahnemann himself who developed this law into a  therapeutic system of medicine. Orthodox medicine in the eighteenth century  was often ineffectual and dangerous, being described by medical historians even  today, as frequently causing more harm than good.</p>
      <p>Hahnemann experimented for many years on  himself, his family and a small but growing group of followers. His first  experiment was with Peruvian Bark (cinchona) which was used at the time to  treat malaria. He took repeated doses of this herb until his body responded  with fever, chills and other symptoms similar to malaria. Hahnemann concluded  that the reason this herb was beneficial in malaria was because it caused  symptoms similar to those of the disease it was treating.          He coined the phrase 'Similia Similibus  Curentur' which refers to the principle that   'likes are cured by likes'.</p>
